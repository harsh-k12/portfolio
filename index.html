    	<li><h2><p> I live in Ghaziabad,UP.<br>
			Currently, I got admission in BCA and learning Web-Development online. <br>
			I love to read novels, autobiograpies, best seller books related to communication skill,  bussiness startup and I am to curious to know more about "Law of attraction" & "Sub-conscious mind" so I read lots of books related to them till now but nevertheless, lots of books still left to read.<br>In most of the free time, I used to listen music and play guitar.<br>
			I passed class 12 with computer subject so I have little knowledge of C++ or SQL.<br>

	 	Few months ago, I descide to be a programmer and I want to program a PC game's like I love to play. After a little-bit of research over internet, I got to know that C++ is a must learn language if one wants to create pc games. So my further plan is to be a pro in this language.<br>But at first I am learning Web-development, then I will try to learn Android-app-development. And further I want to learn AI.
